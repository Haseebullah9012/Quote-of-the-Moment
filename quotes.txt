Responsive is Better than Fast
Anything added, Dilutes everything else
Practicality beats Purity
Approachable is Better than Simple
Mind your Words, they are Important
Speak like a Human
Half-Measures are as Bad as Nothing at all
Encourage Flow
Non-Blocking is Better than Blocking
Favor Focus over Features
Avoid Administrative Distraction
Design for Failure
Keep it Logically Awesome
Knowledge is Power
Seek the Treasure
